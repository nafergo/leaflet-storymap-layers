Scroll-driven story map, with narrative text and multiple GeoJSON layers, using Leaflet and jQuery

based on https://github.com/JackDougherty/leaflet-storymap-layers


- Scroll the storymap to add/remove GeoJSON layers and tell a story about changing lines or boundaries over time.
- Scroll-driven navigation, using screen swipe, trackpad, or keyboard down-arrow. Initial map displays all point markers. Viewers can pan and zoom the map independently of the narration to explore further.
- Easy-to-learn template to create your own storymap. Upload text, point coordinates, zoom levels, and image links to a CSV generic spreadsheet, and drag into http://geojson.io to create a GeoJSON data file.
- Images can be stored in local subfolder or pulled from an external URL.
- Works in modern browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer 9+.
